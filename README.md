Lane Detection System using OpenCV
This repository implements a lane detection system utilizing OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library. The primary purpose of the project is to detect lane lines from video footage of roadways and provide visual feedback on lane curvature and direction. This solution is designed to assist in autonomous vehicle navigation and road analysis.
